This portfolio is split up into two separate tasks which will test your knowledge of applying machine learning algorithms to real datasets. Each task should be zipped up into a single zip folder containing all source code, resource files (datasets) and the report for each section (regression and classification).
Throughout this module, you will be taught many machine learning algorithms (regression and classification) such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines/Regressor (SVM/R), Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours. You will be given an explanation on how they work along with some practical examples. Your task is to apply this knowledge to two datasets of your choice (or one if the dataset can be used for both regression and classification), explain how the model works (research task) and evaluate the model’s performance. You will choose two algorithms for regression and two for classification. You will then compare accuracies and write a short report evaluating the results.
The datasets below can be used for your assessment, alternatively, you can find your own, www.kaggle.com

 is one of the most commonly used websites to find datasets. Some of the following datasets have a documentation file to explain what each feature represents, some may not as the features are self-explanatory. Most datasets can be used for regression and classification as some of the features will have continuous variables, and some will be classes/groups. Make sure you dataset is suitable, if you are unsure, please ask a member of the module team.

Task
Task 1: Regression Task 
1.	Create a regression model using algorithm 1 – state which algorithm and submit working source code 
2.	Create a regression model using algorithm 2 – state which algorithm and submit working source code 
3.	Report (60 marks) – you should use the points below as a guide, you may also write about different areas of what you have submitted with regards to your code.
○	Showing accuracies of each model. Which did better? Explanation of how the two models work (include references). Why did one perform better than the other for your dataset? Suggest on different methods to improve your models. E.g. Remove/add data? If so, which features would you build on? Think about visualising the data first and seeing which features do not help with the prediction. 

Task 2: Classification Task (predicting a class for a new input) 
Create a classification model using algorithm 1 – state which algorithm and submit working source code 
Create a classification model using algorithm 2 – state which algorithm and submit working source code 
Report (60 marks) – you should use the points below as a guide, you may also write about different areas of what you have submitted with regards to your code.
